# RocketPendulum: 3D rocket-pendulum 

A 3D pendulum system with a top and bottom mass connected by a massless rod. Uses a quaternion reference frame to avoid "gimbal lock" phenomena common with 3-dimensional Euclidean reference frames. This code includes a robust visualization with GLMakie visualization in Julia and incorporates various control methods for the nonlinear system.
